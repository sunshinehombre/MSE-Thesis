\chapter{Soot-Chemistry-Turbulence Interactions\label{ch:subfilter}}

In this chapter, two models for interactions between soot, turbulence, and combustion chemistry at subfilter scales are presented. These models are validated in an \textit{a priori} analysis of filtered moment source terms for oxidation and surface growth using the DNS database of Attili \etal~\cite{attili2014}.

%% Summary: Whole point of the chapter is to show that including a mixture fraction dependence in the soot subfilter model may lead to better predictions of $f_v$.
