\section{Modeling the Particle Size Distribution}
\label{sec:subfilter:ndf}

Soot particles exist in a variety of sizes. Incipient particles have diameters on the order of tens of nanometers while aggregates formed from various growth modes can have length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers~\cite{vanderwal1999}. The distribution of soot particle sizes in a system can be specified with the Number Density Function (NDF).
