\section{Evaluation in LES}
\label{sec:subfilter:leszussp}

LES of a series of turbulent, nonpremixed, ethylene-hydrogen-nitrogen [40/41/19 by volume] jet flames~\cite{mahmoud2017} is used to validate the $Z$-uniform soot subfilter PDF (\cref{eq:subfilter:zussp:dd}) in the framework presented in \cref{ch:lesmodels}. This is achieved by comparing thermocouple readings of flame temperature and laser-induced incandescence (LII) measurements of soot volume fraction with the profiles from LES. In this series, three flames are maintained at a jet exit Reynolds number of 15,000 while the exit strain rate is varied by altering the jet diameter and fuel exit velocity. A uniform coflow of air at a velocity of 1.1 m/s surrounds these flames. \cref{tab:subfilter:leszussp:ehn} summarizes other key aspects of the experimental setup, and complete details can be obtained from Mahmoud et al.~\cite{mahmoud2017}.

A brief description of the numerical approach is provided here and will be addressed fully in \cref{ch:lesresults}. Grid filtered LES is achieved through NGA, a low-Mach number flow solver~\cite{desjardins2008}. The computational domain of each flame consists of a structured grid with $192 \times 96 \times 32$ points in the streamwise, radial, and circumferential directions, respectively. This corresponds to a domain with lengths $200D$ in the streamwise direction and $60D$ in the radial direction, where the grid is stretched for both. The flamelet solutions in the database are computed with FlameMaster, a solver for 0D and 1D flame calculations~\cite{flamemaster}. These solutions utilize the chemical mechanism of Blanquart et al.~\cite{blanquart2009588}, which encompasses the high temperature combustion of fuels from methane to iso-octane and places emphasis on the formation of soot precursors up to cyclopenta[cd]pyrene (\ce{C18H10}). The mechanism of Narayanaswamy et al.~\cite{narayanaswamy2010} is incorporated into the base mechanism to model the high-temperature oxidation of aromatic species.

In \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval}, it is clear that time-averaged, centerline flame temperature is generally well-predicted by LES in all flames. In the recorded experiments, the flame temperature rises to a peak value around $x/D = 100$, at which point it declines due to the presence of soot. The flame with the highest exit strain rate ($1/\tau|_H$, left plot) possesses a small region of uniform temperature around $x/D = 0$ due to the lifting of the flame in LES. This feature is not present in the experiment, and therefore explains the slight deviation from the empirical values until about $x/D = 50$. In all three flames, the peak mean temperature from LES closely matches the magnitude of the corresponding experimental value (1800 to 1900 K), but is shifted slightly downstream.

Most obvious in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval} is the underprediction of the time-averaged, centerline soot volume fraction by LES. In all three flames, the volume fraction is underestimated by more than two orders of magnitude relative to the empirical values. Furthermore, the mean soot volume fractions from LES peak slightly earlier and approach zero sooner at approximately $x/D = 130$. These phenomena signal the presence of intense oxidation further upstream compared to the experiments. Such a disparity between the predicted and measured profiles raises the question of what could be modeled inaccurately. To determine the source of this inconsistency, the assumptions and deficiencies of the models need to be revisited.

The soot volume fraction is a measure of the total volume of soot relative to the total volume of gas. The amount of soot that is present depends on the rates of nucleation, condensation, surface growth, and oxidation. An underprediction of the volume fraction suggests that soot growth through nucleation, condensation, and surface growth is insufficient, or that soot oxidation is overwhelmingly excessive. Expressions for the filtered moment source terms of these modes are similar in form to \cref{eq:lesmodels:presumedpdf:separated}. For example, the filtered moment source term for oxidation is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:subfilter:leszussp:ox}
  \begin{split}
    \mean{\dot{M}}_{x,y}^{ox} &= \iint k_{ox}(Z)\mc{M}_j P(\mc{M}_j)\pz dZ d\mc{M}_j \\
    &= \hat{k}_{ox}\mean{M}_j,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k_{ox}(Z)$ is the oxidation coefficient, $\pz$ is modeled with a beta distribution as in \cref{eq:lesmodels:presumedpdf:trimarg}, and the soot subfilter PDF $P(\mc{M}_j)$ is provided in \cref{eq:subfilter:zussp:dd}. Contributions from the thermochemical and soot variables are made distinct in the second line, where $\hat{k}_{ox} = \int k_{ox}(Z)\pz dZ$ and $\mean{M}_j = \int \mc{M}_j P(\mc{M}_j)d\mc{M}_j$. \cref{eq:subfilter:leszussp:ox} incorporates the joint PDF simplification of Mueller and Pitsch~\cite{subfilterpdf2011}, which postulates that the soot scalars should be independent of the thermochemical variables due to the long timescales of PAH and soot formation relative to the timescales of the highly exothermic combustion chemistry. However, they also noted that such an assumption could be violated when surface growth near the flame is the dominant growth mechanism or during the oxidation of soot, when interactions with gas-phase chemistry are enhanced. The likelihood of the former is smaller, as the DNS studies of Bisetti et al.~\cite{bisetti2012} demonstrated that soot growth through PAH-based nucleation and condensation dominates acetylene-based surface growth in turbulent nonpremixed combustion. Thus, this work hypothesizes that the excessive oxidation of soot, due to the inappropriate simplification of the joint subfilter PDF \cref{eq:lesmodels:presumedpdf:bayes}, is the reason for the dramatic underprediction of the soot volume fraction as shown in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval}.

As a result of the decorrelation of the soot scalars from the thermochemical variables, the current soot subfilter PDF implictly assumes that soot is uniformly distributed in mixture fraction space. However, for non-smoking flames, this is qualitatively incorrect as there should be zero soot in fuel-lean regions of the flame. This is evident in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:ysvsz}, reproduced from the 3D DNS of a nitrogen-diluted, \textit{n}-heptane/air turbulent nonpremixed planar jet flame~\cite{attili2014}. The lack of soot at mixture fractions below stoichiometric can be explained by the preferential transport of soot generated in the region $0.3 < Z < 0.5$ to richer regions by turbulent fluctuations and by the oxidation of all soot during transport towards the stoichiometric surface.

The small gray dots represent the soot mass fraction field at 20 ms.}

The non-uniform nature of soot in mixture fraction space is captured by the flamelet solutions that are accessed during LES as well. Filtered moment source term coefficients for oxidation, surface growth, and the combination of nucleation and condensation are plotted in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:kvsz}. It is clear that different soot evolution modes are dominant over distinct regions of mixture fraction even as the fuel mixture and stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate are varied. Soot growth through PAH-based nucleation and condensation prevails at very rich values of mixture fraction, whereas acetylene-based surface growth is more dominant at moderately rich mixture fractions. It is noteable that for a fixed fuel mixture (middle and right plots), a reduction in the value of stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate induces a large increase in the coefficient for nucleation and condensation while the coefficient for surface growth is lessened. This trend is due to the increasing effectiveness of PAH chemistry at smaller values of scalar dissipation rate. Thus, PAH-based soot growth is supported at leaner conditions, which ultimately supplants acetylene-based surface growth.

Soot oxidation is the dominant mode at mixture fractions below and slightly above the stoichiometric value. Since the rates associated with the high-temperature oxidation chemistry are comparable with those of the main heat-releasing chemistry~\cite{guo2016}, it is anticipated that the magnitude of the peak oxidation coefficient will not vary much as the fuel mixture or stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate is modified. Indeed, this phenomenon is evident in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:kvsz}. Additionally, the oxidation coefficient at stoichiometric mixture fraction is at least an order of magnitude larger than the maximum value of the surface growth coefficient. Thus, the complete oxidation of soot by \ce{OH} (and \ce{O2} to a lesser degree) is expected during transport towards stoichiometric regions. However, the soot subfilter PDF given by \cref{eq:subfilter:zussp:dd} allows for the existence of soot in fuel-lean areas, as it assumes that soot is uniformly distributed in mixture fraction space. The presence of large, non-zero oxidation coefficients at lean values of mixture fraction is therefore concerning, as it potentially leads to substantial filtered moment source terms (\cref{eq:subfilter:leszussp:ox}). This contribution to the oxidation rate is artificial and could be an explanation for the underpredicted soot volume fraction in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval}. To prevent this non-physical oxidation from occurring, the subfilter PDF must depend on the thermochemical variables to exclude the presence of soot at lean mixtures $Z < Z_{st}$. A soot subfilter PDF that addresses this point is introduced in the following section.
