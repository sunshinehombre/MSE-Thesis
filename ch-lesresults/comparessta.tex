Results from the LES using the $Z$-Activated Soot Subfilter PDF were presented in \cref{sec:lesresults:zassp} under the assumption of unity effective Lewis numbers for all gas-phase species. This assumption is appropriate when turbulent transport dominates molecular diffusion within the fuel-oxidizer mixing zone and when the species' length scales are comparable to the length scale of the latter. In \cref{ch:transport}, this was found to be inappropriate for PAH, whose formation chemistry is slow relative to turbulent mixing. PAH are confined to regions of low scalar dissipation rate that are on the order of the Kolmogorov scale or smaller~\cite{vaishnavi2008}, so they are governed by molecular transport. The Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach was developed in \cref{sec:transport:ssta} to more accurately model the behavior of PAH and similar species with relatively slow chemistry. In this section, LES results with the aforementioned approach will be compared to experimental data and data from LES with other transport models. The goal is to evaluate the ability of the proposed transport model to more accurately predict the evolution of soot, so the $Z$-Activated Soot Subfilter PDF will be implemented in all cases of interest.

In \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:f2lecomparison}, the time-averaged, centerline flame temperature is plotted for flame $1/\tau|_M$ of \cref{tab:subfilter:leszussp:ehn}. It is clear that the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers and the Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach predict the flame temperature fairly accurately, while the LES with detailed transport for gas-phase species predicts a much longer flame with a higher maximum temperature. The peak mean temperatures of the former two LES closely match the magnitude of the experimental value but are shifted slightly downstream as in \cref{fig:lesresults:zassp:ctrlineleseval}. The LES with full detailed transport accounts for the small Lewis number of the hydrogen radical, which causes a convective velocity towards below-stoichiometric regions in mixture fraction space. Consequently, the flame temperature is observed to peak in the leaner regions further downstream, where the hydrogren radicals participate more frequently in reactions that contribute to an elevated maximum flame temperature. % The LES with full detailed transport accounts for the high diffusivity of the hydrogen radical, which promotes its presence at locations far downstream and allows for more frequent participation in various reactions that contribute to an elevated maximum flame temperature.

As before, the time-averaged, centerline soot volume fractions are underpredicted by all simulations. For the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers and the Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach, the volume fractions peak at $x/D \approx 80$, versus the experimental maximum at $x/D \approx 100$, and approach zero earlier at $x/D \approx 130$ to 140. On the other hand, the LES that models all gas-phase species with molecular transport predicts a larger soot volume fraction at locations further downstream and has a volume fraction maximum at nearly the same location as the experiment. Its peak volume fraction is more than four times larger than that of the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers and slightly more than twice the maximum value from the LES with the Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach. The increased volume fraction further downstream can be attributed to the elongated flame structure, which enables soot to accumulate for a longer period of time before oxidation. % These two phenomena result from modeling the hydrogen radical with molecular transport, which allows it to diffuse further downstream and contribute to soot growth through the \ce{H}-abstraction, \ce{C2H2}-addition surface reaction mechanism~\cite{frenklach1985,frenklach1991}.

Additionally, the hydrogen radical is modeled with molecular transport, which allows it to diffuse further downstream and contribute to soot growth through the \ce{H}-abstraction, \ce{C2H2}-addition surface reaction mechanism~\cite{frenklach1985,frenklach1991}. This behavior can be seen more clearly in \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:radialdfvdtf2lecomparison}, where the LES with detailed transport possesses a normalized time-averaged soot volume fraction source term for surface growth that has a proportionally larger contribution when compared to the LES with the other transport models. In fact, at $x/D = 94$, it becomes the most dominant component for the LES with detailed transport. Conversely, the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers and the Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach have oxidation by \ce{OH} and \ce{O2} as the most prominent source term at the same axial location.

However, the hydrogen radical is not identified as a species with relatively slow chemistry in \cref{fig:transport:ssta:dependencies:chist}. It is not confined to regions of low scalar dissipation rate that are on the order of the Kolmogorov scale or smaller, so modeling its behavior with molecular diffusion is inappropriate. This point is clearly demonstrated by the inaccurate flame temperature profile of the LES with detailed transport in \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:f2lecomparison}. The Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach more accurately models its physics as well as the physics of species with relatively slow chemistry. In \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:f2lecomparison}, the LES with the latter model generally predicts a larger soot volume fraction over the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers. A closer look at the relative contributions of the various volume fraction source terms in \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:radialdfvdtf2lecomparison} reveals that at $x/D = 49$, the LES with the proposed model has nucleation and condensation occurring at a larger proportion than in the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers. Such a trend is responsible for the increased volume fraction at that location and further downstream, as observed in \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:f2lecomparison}.

%nucleation, condensation, surface growth, and oxidation occurring at roughly the same proportions as the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers. However, by $x/D = 71$, the LES with the strain-sensitive transport approach predicts a higher amount of condensation relative to nucleation for $r/D \le 2$ when compared to the LES with unity effective Lewis numbers. Such a trend is responsible for the increased volume fraction in the region around $x/D = 71$, as observed in \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:f2lecomparison}.

The previously discussed results use the chemical mechanism from Blanquart \etal~\cite{blanquart2009} and Narayanaswamy \etal~\cite{narayanaswamy2010} (identified as the BN1 mechanism), which places emphasis on the formation of soot precursors up to cyclopenta[cd]pyrene (\ce{C18H10}). The sensitivity of soot evolution to the kinetics was also assessed by performing LES with the chemical mechanism from Wang \etal~\cite{wang2013} (identified as the KM2 mechanism), while modeling gas-phase species with unity effective Lewis numbers and with the Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach. In \cref{fig:lesresults:ssta:f2lemechcomparison}, it is evident that the time-averaged, centerline flame temperatures from these LES closely match the experimental data. However, the soot volume fractions are obviously increased. The peak time-averaged volume fraction from the LES using the KM2 mechanism with unity effective Lewis numbers is 29 ppb, which is roughly tenfold larger than the maximum value from the corresponding LES with the BN1 mechanism (2.9 ppb). The LES using the KM2 mechanism with the Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach has a peak volume fraction of 46.7 ppb, which is within a factor of ten of the peak experimental value and is about eight times larger than the maximum value from the corresponding LES with the BN1 mechanism (6.0 ppb). Clearly, the results are sensitive to the chemical kinetics. However, the LES with the KM2 mechanism still underpredicts the soot volume fraction by a factor of ten, suggesting that the model is still missing some aspect of the physics of soot evolution, and uncertainties in chemical kinetics alone are not enough to explain the discrepancies. % The KM2 mechanism accounts for PAH species up to coronene (\ce{C24H12}), which has seven aromatic rings compared to the five fused rings of cyclopenta[cd]pyrene. The LES results suggest that the kinetics of these larger PAH may play an important role in the evolution of soot, as was found in previous studies~\cite{wang2013,selvaraj2016}.

The evolution of soot is clearly sensitive to the kinetics of PAH precursors, as evidenced by the increase in the maximum volume fraction by a factor of 7.7 to 9.8 with the KM2 chemical mechanism compared to that from Blanquart \etal~\cite{blanquart2009} and Narayanaswamy \etal~\cite{narayanaswamy2010}. However, note that accurately modeling the interactions of PAH and other species that influence the development of soot particles with turbulence cannot be neglected. The Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach elevates predictions of the peak volume fraction by a preliminary factor of 1.6 to 2.1 over the equal effective diffusivities approach. Improvements to the proposed models, which will be discussed in \cref{sec:conclusion:future}, could potentially make the sensitivity to the turbulent interactions as influential as the sensitivity to the chemical mechanism.
