\section{Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach}
\label{sec:lesresults:ssta}

Include comparison of EHN, Stanford, ZASSP, and $Le = 1$ vs. $\check{Le}_i(\zeta_i)$ vs. $Le_i$.

Also include the effect of the chemical mechanism with a comparison of EHN, Stanford, ZASSP, and $\check{Le}_i(\zeta_i)$ with EHN, KM2, ZASSP, and $Le = 1$ vs. $\check{Le}_i(\zeta_i)$.

Talk about temperature, $Y_{PAH}$, $f_V$, conditional radial statistics at various distances downstream, etc.
