\section{Z-Activated Soot Subfilter PDF}
\label{sec:lesresults:zassp}

Main points I want to make about ZASSP: The centerline temperature is still well predeicted compmared to the ZUSSP modmel, but the centerline volume fraction has barely changed when compare to the ZUSSP model. Looking at the radial statistics, it is clear tht he volume fraction is severely underpediceted as well. The flame structue is also too thin. Can look at the dfvdt source terms for mucl+cond, surface growth, and oxidation in the centerline and radial directions vs. Z (think if this makes any sense to show both). Effect of ZASSP supposed to be strongest for oxidation vs surface growth, so show instantaneous or time averaged 2D color plots of fv, number density (?), primary particle diameter (?), and intermittency (?). 

In \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval}, it is clear that time-averaged, centerline flame temperature is generally well-predicted by LES in all flames. In the recorded experiments, the flame temperature rises to a peak value around $x/D = 100$, at which point it declines due to the presence of soot. The flame with the highest exit strain rate ($1/\tau|_H$, left plot) possesses a small region of uniform temperature around $x/D = 0$ due to the lifting of the flame in LES. This feature is not present in the experiment, and therefore explains the slight deviation from the empirical values until about $x/D = 50$. In all three flames, the peak mean temperature from LES closely matches the magnitude of the corresponding experimental value (1800 to 1900 K), but is shifted slightly downstream.

Most obvious in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval} is the underprediction of the time-averaged, centerline soot volume fraction by LES. In all three flames, the volume fraction is underestimated by more than two orders of magnitude relative to the empirical values. Furthermore, the mean soot volume fractions from LES peak slightly earlier and approach zero sooner at approximately $x/D = 130$. These phenomena signal the presence of intense oxidation further upstream compared to the experiments. Such a disparity between the predicted and measured profiles raises the question of what is modeled inaccurately. To determine the source of this inconsistency, the assumptions and deficiencies of the models need to be revisited.

The soot volume fraction is a measure of the total volume of soot relative to the total volume of gas. The amount of soot that is present depends on the rates of nucleation, condensation, surface growth, and oxidation. An underprediction of the volume fraction suggests that soot growth through nucleation, condensation, and surface growth is insufficient, or that soot oxidation is overwhelmingly excessive. Expressions for the filtered moment source terms of these modes are similar in form to \cref{eq:lesmodels:presumedpdf:separated}. For example, the filtered moment source term for oxidation is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:subfilter:leszussp:ox}
  \begin{split}
    \mean{\dot{M}}_{x,y}^{ox} &= \iint k_{ox}(Z)\mc{M}_j P(\mc{M}_j)\pz dZ d\mc{M}_j \\
    &= \hat{k}_{ox}\mean{M}_j,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k_{ox}(Z)$ is the oxidation coefficient, $\pz$ is modeled with a beta distribution as in \cref{eq:lesmodels:presumedpdf:trimarg}, and the soot subfilter PDF $P(\mc{M}_j)$ is provided in \cref{eq:subfilter:zussp:dd}. Contributions from the thermochemical and soot variables are made distinct in the second line, where $\hat{k}_{ox} = \int k_{ox}(Z)\pz dZ$ and $\mean{M}_j = \int \mc{M}_j P(\mc{M}_j)d\mc{M}_j$. \cref{eq:subfilter:leszussp:ox} incorporates the joint PDF simplification of Mueller and Pitsch~\cite{subfilterpdf2011}, which postulates that the soot scalars should be independent of the thermochemical variables due to the long timescales of PAH and soot formation relative to the timescales of the highly exothermic combustion chemistry. However, they also noted that such an assumption could be violated when surface growth near the flame is the dominant growth mechanism or during the oxidation of soot, when interactions with gas-phase chemistry are enhanced. The likelihood of the former is smaller, as the DNS studies of Bisetti \etal~\cite{bisetti2012} demonstrated that soot growth through PAH-based nucleation and condensation dominates acetylene-based surface growth in turbulent nonpremixed combustion. Therefore, this work hypothesizes that the excessive oxidation of soot, due to the simplification of the joint subfilter PDF (\cref{eq:lesmodels:presumedpdf:bayes}), is the reason for the dramatic underprediction of the soot volume fraction as shown in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval}.

As a result of the decorrelation of the soot scalars from the thermochemical variables, the current soot subfilter PDF implictly assumes that soot is uniformly distributed in mixture fraction space. However, for non-smoking flames, this is qualitatively incorrect as there should be zero soot in fuel-lean regions of the flame. This is evident in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:ysvsz}, reproduced from the 3D DNS of a nitrogen-diluted, \textit{n}-heptane/air turbulent nonpremixed planar jet flame~\cite{attili2014}. The lack of soot at mixture fractions below stoichiometric can be explained by the preferential transport of soot generated in the region $0.3 < Z < 0.5$ to richer mixture fractions by turbulent fluctuations and by the oxidation of all soot during transport towards the stoichiometric surface.

The non-uniform nature of soot in mixture fraction space is captured by the flamelet solutions that are accessed during LES as well. Filtered moment source term coefficients for oxidation, surface growth, and the combination of nucleation and condensation are plotted in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:kvsz}. It is clear that different soot evolution modes are dominant over distinct regions of mixture fraction even as the fuel mixture and stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate are varied. Soot growth through PAH-based nucleation and condensation prevails at very rich values of mixture fraction, whereas acetylene-based surface growth is more dominant at moderately rich mixture fractions. It is notable that for a fixed fuel mixture (middle and right plots), a reduction in the value of stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate induces a large increase in the coefficient for nucleation and condensation while the coefficient for surface growth is lessened. This trend is due to the increasing effectiveness of PAH chemistry at smaller values of scalar dissipation rate. Therefore, PAH-based soot growth is supported at leaner conditions, which ultimately supplants acetylene-based surface growth.

Soot oxidation is the dominant mode at mixture fractions below and slightly above the stoichiometric value. Since the rates associated with the high-temperature oxidation chemistry are comparable with those of the main heat-releasing chemistry~\cite{guo2016}, it is anticipated that the magnitude of the peak oxidation coefficient will not vary much as the fuel mixture or stoichiometric scalar dissipation rate is modified. Indeed, this phenomenon is evident in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:kvsz}. Additionally, the oxidation coefficient at stoichiometric mixture fraction is at least an order of magnitude larger than the maximum value of the surface growth coefficient. Thus, the complete oxidation of soot by \ce{OH} (and \ce{O2} to a lesser degree) is expected during transport towards stoichiometric regions. However, the soot subfilter PDF given by \cref{eq:subfilter:zussp:dd} permits the existence of soot in fuel-lean areas, for it assumes that soot is uniformly distributed in mixture fraction space. Therefore, the presence of large, non-zero oxidation coefficients at lean values of mixture fraction is concerning, for it potentially leads to substantial filtered moment source terms (\cref{eq:subfilter:leszussp:ox}). This contribution to the oxidation rate is artificial and could be an explanation for the underpredicted soot volume fraction in \cref{fig:subfilter:leszussp:zusspleseval}. To prevent this non-physical oxidation from occurring, the subfilter PDF must depend on the thermochemical variables to exclude the presence of soot at lean mixtures $Z < Z_{st}$. A soot subfilter PDF that addresses this point is introduced in the following section.

Perhaps have a comparison of flamelets first to give hints at what to expect in terms of $Y_{PAH}$ and $f_V$. Include comparison of EHN, Stanford, $\check{Le}_i(\zeta_i)$, and ZUSSP vs. ZASSP.

Talk about temperature, $Y_{PAH}$, $f_V$, conditional radial statistics at various distances downstream, etc.
