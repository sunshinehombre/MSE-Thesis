Perhaps have a comparison of flamelets first to give hints at what to expect in terms of $Y_{PAH}$ and $f_V$. Include comparison of EHN, Stanford, $\check{Le}_i(\zeta_i)$, and ZUSSP vs. ZASSP.

Talk about temperature, $Y_{PAH}$, $f_V$, conditional radial statistics at various distances downstream, etc.
