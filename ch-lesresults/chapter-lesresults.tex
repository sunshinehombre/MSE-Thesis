\chapter{Large Eddy Simulation of Turbulent Nonpremixed Jet Flames\label{ch:lesresults}}

%Summary: This chapter covers all details on the experimental and computational framework used and the LES results that have incorporated the previous models discussed.

The $Z$-Activated Soot Subfilter PDF and the Strain-Sensitive Transport Approach have been motivated and developed in \cref{ch:subfilter,ch:transport}. These models are now validated against experimental data from a series of turbulent nonpremixed simple jet flames in this chapter. Before these results are presented, the experimental and computational frameworks are outlined.
