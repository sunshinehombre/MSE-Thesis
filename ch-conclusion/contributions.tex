\section{Major Contributions}
\label{sec:conclusion:contributions}

This thesis has presented several advancements in modeling small-scale interactions between soot, chemistry, and turbulence as well as the transport of species with relatively slow chemistry in turbulent nonpremixed combustion. These models were developed for Large Eddy Simulation (LES), where the geometry-dependent, large-scale phenomena are resolved and the small-scale features are modeled. The goal of these models is to profligate the designs of more environmentally friendly aircraft engines by enabling rapid design optimizations.
