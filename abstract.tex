The former is based on the presumed subfilter PDF method, where the distribution of blah is assumed. It contains a dependence on theh mixture fraction to address the lack of soot in fuel-lean regions and has the form of a double-delta distribution to account for the high spatial intermittency of soot. The strain-sensitive transport approach is a model that transports species governed by relatively slow formation chemistry with molecular diffusion and transports species governed by fast kinetics with equal effective diffusivities. A strain-sensitivity parameter is formulated to categorize each species. The final objective of this thesis is to validate these models in Large Eddy Simulations (LES). A series of three laboratory-scale ethylene-hydrogen-nitrogen simple jet flames are used as the testbench.
