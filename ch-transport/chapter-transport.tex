\chapter{Effect of Transport on Soot Evolution\label{ch:transport}}

Summary: Main point of chapter is to show that existing transport models do not properly account for the presence of soot. As a result, a strain sensitive transport model is developed.

Include a brief introduction explaining why accurately capturing the transport of gas-phase species is important for developing predictive models for soot evolution in LES (growth and oxixidation processes).
