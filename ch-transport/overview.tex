\section{Overview of Gas-Phase Species Transport}
\label{sec:transport:overview}

Provide an overview of different transport modeling approaches and discuss their deficiencies.


\subsection{Equal Effective Diffusivities}
\label{sec:transport:overview:le1}

Summary of equal effective diffusivities approach.


\subsection{Considerations for PAH}
\label{sec:transport:overview:pah}

Explain why PAH requires another mode of transport (sensitivity to $\chi$ due to slow chemistry suggests molecular transport is more appropriate).


\subsection{Molecular Transport}
\label{sec:transport:overview:lei}

Summary of detailed transport approach.


\subsection{Bimodal Transport}
\label{sec:transport:overview:bimodal}

Summary of approaches that account for equal effective diffusivities as well as detailed transport (Wang).
