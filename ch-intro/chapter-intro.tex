\chapter{Introduction\label{ch:intro}}
 
Soot is a carbonaceous product formed from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. Although soot may appear as a dark cloud or plume to the naked eye, it is actually a collection of nanoscale particles, as shown in \cref{fig:intro:dieselsoot}. Soot particles are required to increase the radiant energy of flames in furnaces and boilers, but they are also an undesired waste product in many engineering systems such as internal combustion engines, gas turbine combustors, and combustion-based power plants. If released into the atmosphere, soot can contribute to haze, global warming, and acid rain. Exposure to these particles results in an increased risk for a variety of ailments including strokes~\cite{popeiii2006}, atherosclerosis~\cite{polichetti2009,kennedy2007,popeiii2006}, lung cancer~\cite{kennedy2007,popeiii2006}, and cardiovascular mortality~\cite{polichetti2009,kennedy2007,popeiii2006}, and these adverse health effects have been observed to be closely related the number, composition, and size of particles rather than their mass~\cite{seaton1995,lighty2000}. While the fate of federal regulations for particulate matter under the current administration of President Donald J. Trump is unclear, these regulations are expected to become more stringent in the coming decades.

The production of next-generation, environmentally friendly combustion systems will depend on numerical simulation for rapid design optimization. The task of predicting how soot evolves in the turbulent reacting flows of these systems is nontrivial and will require high-fidelity models for soot, combustion, and turbulence. The large range of spatial and temporal scales present in these systems makes the development of each component model extremely challenging. Furthermore, integration into a single framework necessitates accounting for the interactions between models. Today's state-of-the-art simulations have progressed towards achieving this goal, but significant work still lies ahead. 

The overall objective of this thesis is to advance the understanding of how turbulence affects the dynamics of soot. Specifically, the small-scale interactions between soot, chemistry, and turbulence as well as the transport of species in turbulent nonpremixed combustion are analyzed. A survey of previous investigations on both topics is presented in the upcoming sections, but first, a brief overview of the processes that guide the evolution of soot is provided.


%% ***
%% My rough idea for intro:
%% What is soot and why it needs to be studied/modeled
%% Explanation of dynamics of soot/various modes of evolution

%% Goal is to motivate need for ZASSP (closure model for soot transport equation SOOT MODEL that accounts for spatial intermittency of soot (soot-turbulence interactions) as well as its interaction/connection to combustion chemistry). Also need to motivate need for SSTA (transport approach that uses the nonpremixed flamelet framework TURBULENT COMBUSTION MODEL WITH EMPHASIS ON SOOT PRECURSORS with differential diffusion, transporting species with relatively slow chemistry with molecular diffusion and species with fast chemistry with unity effective Lewis numbers).

%% SOOT-TURBULENCE-CHEMISTRY INTERACTIONS:
%% Effects of turbulence on soot, experimental evidence of influence of strain
%% Previous modeling attempts of soot evolution in turbulent combustion: RANS, LES, DNS (highlight findings and weaknesses)
%% Explain how the model I developed will address these deficiencies

%% EFFECT OF TRANSPORT ON SOOT EVOLUTION:
%% Mention species that influence soot evolution and dictate flame structure have a variety of molecular weights and scales.
%% Somehow incorporate experimental findings into this section
%% Previous modeling attempts for transport of species in turbulent combustion (highlight findings and weaknesses, especially with consideration of soot)
%% Explain how the turbulent combustion transport model will address these deficiencies
